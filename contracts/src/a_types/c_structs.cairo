# We are able to group a bunch of felts together to form a struct. Structs are
# similar to class in the OOP world minus the ability to have methods.
# It is a nice convenient way to group a bunch of related information together
# eg. :
# struct UserScore {
#   username: felt,
#   score: felt
# }
# Here we see that the username and scores are related info and hence we bunch them together
# to form a simple entity
